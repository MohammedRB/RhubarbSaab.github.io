			<span class="title">Biological Aging - Can We Turn Back Time?</span>
		</h1>

		<article>
			<h3><span class="title">Introduction</span></h3>
			<p>As humans we all age, some quicker than others. In general aging can be seen as the process at which the body slowly becomes weaker over time due to problems that can arise from several factors. This means that "death due to old age" is not an actual cause of death as one part of the body is so worn out/ damaged that it can no longer do its function, therefore resulting in an old person's sudden death. However there has been a lot of money and time being spent on many ways we can increase the longevity of human life so people can live longer and healthier lives. We have discovered many ways we can do this from adopting a healthier diet or using stem cells to regenerate old tissue. However, there is one question that is worth asking... at what age should you choose to die at, since we all die at some point?</p>

			<br>

			<h3><span class="title">Some Causes of Aging</span></h3>
			<h4><span class="title">Senescent Cells</span></h4>
			<p>As you age, your cells replicate to make new cells in place of dead ones. When cell mitosis occurs, it needs to copy the DNA in the cell to make 2 healthy daughter cells. During this process, the chromosomes in the cells may lose some of its DNA at the ends of it, this can be detrimental to the cell as it may potentially cause some essential proteins not to be made. However, our cells have come up with a clever solution to this problem, telomeres. These are longs strands of DNA that are wrapped around the end of chromosomes, and their purpose is to protect the ends of the chromosomes when cell mitosis occurs; but, after every cell replication, they grow shorter and shorter. At a critical point - when the telomeres are too short – the cell will “go through apoptosis: the process in which cells die” according to a doctor teaching Biology at my college. Unfortunately, when they are gone, they become senescent cells – or “zombie” cells.1These cells stay alive longer than they are supposed to; but this stops them from duplicating themselves.1However, the presence of these cells can cause damage to the surrounding cells, and the worse thing is that the older you get, the more of them you accumulate. It has been shows that these cells are linked to problems like kidney damage and Type 2 Diabetes.2 A technique that can be used to remove these cells is by genetically engineering your body to kill off these cells. This was shown by GM lab mice living 30% longer than control mice.3Although this is good, if we want to help people after birth, we could inject them with a protein that tells cells when to die, allowing the senescent cells to be killed off, causing minimal harm to surrounding tissue.4</p>
			<h4><span class="title">NAD+/Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide</span></h4>
			<p>This is a “coenzyme that can help with respiration, other enzymes, and targets metabolism” according to doctor I interviewed. As we age our cell machinery need to be replaced multiple times to make sure that it doesn’t fail on us; but, as we get older, our cells get worse at doing this. This is due to the drop in concentration of NAD+ in our cells. This has also been linked to many diseases like heart diseases and multiple sclerosis.5 We could try and delivering this directly to use through an “NAD+ pill” but, this would not work as the doctor mentioned to me that they “cannot be absorbed through the small intestines”. We can bypass this by giving our cells chemicals that they can convert into NAD+.</p>
			<h4><span class="title">Stem Cells</span></h4>
			<p>These are unspecialised cells that can turn into any cell – these are found in embryos; but adult stem cells can only specialise into a select few cells e.g., red blood cells. It has been shown that as your get older, the number of stem cells you produce is on the decline, resulting in the same happening to you.6To reverse this effect, we could put some more stem cells into ourselves so we can repair all the damaged tissue we have accumulated over the years. A study done on some lab mice showed that by injecting the adult mice’s hypothalamus with stem cells from the brains of younger mice, these new stem cells helped to “give life” back to the neurons in their brains by producing micro-RNA that helped the neurons to regulate their metabolism. After a few months, they saw that the brains and muscles of these mice, compared to control mice, worked much better and they live ~10% longer (on average).7 This shows that the stem cells can help to encourage other cells to get stronger, as well as regenerate lost tissue. </p>

			<h3><span class="title">Health Span Versus Life Span</span></h3>
			<p>It is all well and good to make ourselves live longer and longer lives; but is it worth living a long life when you could still be susceptible to many ailments that still plague humanity as a whole? The scientific community has now been moving their attention to increasing people’s health spans: the time that a person lives in good health. By focusing more attention of improving people health spans, we can allow for them to live in a healthy state for a majority for their life.</p>

			<br>

			<h3><span class="title">Conclusion</span></h3>
			<p>From my research about aging in humans, I have discovered so much more about what goes on in our bodies, from “zombie” cells to cell blueprint (stem cells), there are many factors that can affect how we age. To quote from my discussion with Dr Anning, “aging is mainly due to environmental factors like diet and exercise, and these can affect your gene tags and the way that certain genes can be switched on or off; but, if we did set a tightly controlled experiment, we would find some genetic factors at play.” I do find that these discoveries can send huge waves in the fields of biology and medicine as they can change how we forever view aging. On the other hand, if these were put into, the hands of the wrong people, it could end up back firing; but only time will tell if we will be able to step into his new frontier of research.</p>
